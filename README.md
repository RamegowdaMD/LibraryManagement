# Library Management System

## Overview
The Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to automate the process of managing a library’s resources. The system allows users to borrow and return books, search for books, and manage their accounts. It also provides administrative features to add, remove, and modify books in the library database.

## Features

- **User Management**
  - Register and login users (students, staff, or visitors).
  - View borrowing history and account status.
  
- **Book Management**
  - Search books by title, author, or genre.
  - Add, edit, and remove books from the library catalog (admin feature).
  
- **Book Borrowing & Returning**
  - Borrow books based on availability.
  - Return books and automatically update the inventory.
  - Track due dates and overdue books.

- **Reports and Notifications**
  - View overdue books and fines.
  - Notify users about due dates and overdue items.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if applicable)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django), Java (Spring), or PHP (depending on the system's architecture)
- **Database**: MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL (based on the choice of backend)
- **Version Control**: Git

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before running the system, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x (for Python-based backends)
- MySQL or SQLite (depending on the database used)
- Node.js (if using a JavaScript frontend)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   For Python backend:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For JavaScript frontend (if any):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:
   - Configure the database connection in the `config` file.
   - Run the necessary SQL queries to create tables for books, users, and transactions.

4. **Run the application**:
   For a Flask app:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   
   For Django app:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The application will run at `http://localhost:8000` (or the configured port).

## Usage

- **User Registration**: Go to the signup page, fill in personal details to create an account.
- **Searching for Books**: Use the search bar to search by title, author, or genre.
- **Borrowing a Book**: Click the 'Borrow' button on a book's page, and it will be added to your borrowing list.
- **Returning a Book**: Once you're done, return the book to update its availability.

## Admin Panel
Admins can log in to a separate admin panel to manage books and users:
- **Add a New Book**: Provide details like title, author, genre, and availability.
- **Remove/Update a Book**: Edit or delete a book's record.
- **View Borrowing History**: Monitor borrowing activities of users.
  
## Future Enhancements
- **Mobile App Integration**: A mobile application for ease of use.
- **Fine Calculation System**: Automate the calculation of fines for overdue books.
- **Recommendation System**: Implement book recommendations based on user interests.
